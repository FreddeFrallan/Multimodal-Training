an indistinct shape lying on the seabed
moving closer the shape is revealed to be a turtle
an olive Ridley turtle
she pushes off from the sand with her flipper
all because the eggs she carriers
she breaks the surface
the green and mountainous land masses nearby
she died
sunlight shimmers on the surface above her
she must leave the safety
viewed from Below thundering waves roll towards her
white surf crashes over her shower as she slowly closed her way up the beach
others are also making their journey through the Relentless way
she's heavily Laden
a bird's eye view of countless Turtles
caught between the sea and the jungle thousands of turtles line the long dark sand beach
only those animals that overcome the great challenges
Co
dark Rocky islets in a calm body of water
a thin layer of Fog hangs over the horizon and the water reflects the pastel Sky
a whiskered snout disturbs the surface of the water from Below
it belongs to a sea lion
to confront each other in the water
1 resting in The Shallows another sitting on the Rocks is oily skin shining in the sunlight
he dies from the rocks into the water
using his front flippers he banks left and right through the shallow
briefly resurfacing he snatches a lung full of air before diving back down
heat line through the calm turquoise code now towards the dark open sea
a large silvery fish that is parts
it's part of a fast moving School
viewed from high above the sea lion causes the fish to change Direction
the sea lion briefly arts out of the water as he swims along
half a dozen or so tuna and now cornered in the shallow Co
the fish rapidly you turn
but I give him the slip
the tuna swim back out to sea
the sea lion ducks under than resurfaces
but there might be another way another sea lion jobs into the water from a rocky ledge
he joins the young boy and a circle around each other

the bird's-eye view as the sea lions forced a fish into a shallow corner
the young Bulls slowly rotates in the water and Patiently Waiting
the other sea lions chase the fish further along the channel
with nowhere to go the tuna are forced into a narrow area surrounded by jagged Rock
the young bull remains in one place and acts like a goalkeeper
in a shallow rock pool a sea lion pursues alone tuna
the sea lion trails a line of bubbles as he twists and Turns then eventually he grabs the fish
another sea lion glide through the Channel following his prey
he finally catches it
the fish brushes wildly by the rocks as this sea lion climbs his Jaws around it
another fish is forced out of the water onto a rocky beach
in the Galapagos
he picks up an enormous fish stranded on The Rock
pelicans feed off the scraps
on a diet of protein rich tuna
more seabirds join in

the sea crashes over the rocks as the sunset
the tide coming in
a full moon rising in the night sky
tides are created
the moon cast the silvery light on an otherwise pitch-black coastline

Anil Springs out of the water and snatches the crap
and for good reason
the Eels take body curls over as it slips back into the shadows
the eel lunges out of the water as a group of crabs clean to a Rough they scatter and the Y or Mrs
but the Crab feeding grounds are still a long way off
waves surge around the rocky Island
a crab jumps and lands in the water
it's scuttles desperately Through The Shallows
and it reaches the safety of land
hundreds of Mini waterfalls Tumble down the side of the island
halfway
the Eels slithers out of the water and over the rocks
crossing the land
another leap into the water
an octopus
crab killer
the octopus emerges from its hiding place jobs down from a ledge and slides into a rock pool
the Crab makes another huge relief into the water and scurried along
the octopus Lollards a long and settles into another fall

thank you trees small and tiny follow the robots back to the blocks they were building a tower from when it arrived
a robot grows the blocks into the air and they land forming a perfect Tower
nicely done taking the scroll of building plans the robot makes it into a paper chain of Hearts instead which it gives to tiny

looking up at the Treetops he sees the bike has come to rest high on a branch and he let out a sigh
hearing the noise Ryan terms and C's illuminous yellow translucent square has appeared on they are directly behind him covering several feet above the ground wearing a baffled expression he takes a step towards it and the outline of the square is augmented by beautiful concentric patterns within it
a small circle appears at the centre and Ryan reaches up to touch it
the inexplicable glowing Square Vanishes under befuddled Ryan looks around him
many faces Arms up over his face of the dazzling display of energy lights up the forest
when the light fades there's a strange object resting on the leafy woodland floor
what is a bluish mottled surface and resembles an upturned spinning top about 5 feet tall
cautiously Brian moves towards it and which is a hand out to touch it
the surface briefly becomes brighter and he snatches his hand away
fishing out his mobile phone with his other hand

an explosive blast beyond a darkened doorway then in The Gloom Gracie's movement she starts to back away coming down the aisle of the train to water is a bizarre riding bath in black tentacles
what is the new idea
